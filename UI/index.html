                            Japan is a country I have long wanted to visit, with incredible mountain scenery, one of the world’s most chaotic & quirky cities (Tokyo), a long history of culture & tradition, and of course incredible cuisine with authentic sushi on offer everywhere you turn.
                            I have been asked many times over the past few years of blogging why I have not yet been to Japan, with the answer being that I was just waiting for a time that was right. This is a country I wanted to see as a whole over at least 2 weeks, instead of just flying in for a quick city trip to Tokyo or a ski trip in one of Japan’s famous ski resorts.
                            When I came across the Splendours of Japan Tour with Trafalgar (who I have travelled with previously in Peru), it seemed like a great opportunity to take one of my parents overseas to visit Japan, as I knew either of them would appreciate the culture and history unlike anyone else I knew – so I booked my dad a plane ticket, told him to pack his bags, and we were off!

                    <p>I got up early that morning due to an improper sleep during the previous night. 
                        It was due to the anxiety to start fresh with my new life. 
                        I was determined to be the best in whatever it is that I do. 
                        From my earliest childhood, I was introvert. Therefore, I was afraid of talking to new people because I might look foolish and embarrass myself or just because I thought that, I could do everything by myself. In addition, by reason of nervousness I could start to stammer.

                            Last winter break, I went to stay with her in the village. It so happened that I had my birthday the second day I was there. Knowing that, Granny had already made the arrangements for the celebration - her own way. Early in the morning, she woke me up and gave me a cold bath. Then she took me to the village temple to say her prayers and get blessings for me from the village priest. Also, she arranged a community"langar" for all the villagers. I was so happy and pleased that I could have been there.

                    <p> When I got my joining date, I was very happy. But as the date came nearer, I was a bit nervous. Many questions occupied my brain like how will be the atmosphere of the office, will I be able to adjust with the colleagues, will I be able to work well and completer targets, etc.When I joined the office, on the first day at office, I was little tensed till got acquainted with the workplace and co-workers. But once as days passed, I became comfortable with all. And today love my work and workplace.

                            Japan is a country I have long wanted to visit, with incredible mountain scenery, one of the world’s most chaotic & quirky cities (Tokyo), a long history of culture & tradition, and of course incredible cuisine with authentic sushi on offer everywhere you turn.
                            I have been asked many times over the past few years of blogging why I have not yet been to Japan, with the answer being that I was just waiting for a time that was right. This is a country I wanted to see as a whole over at least 2 weeks, instead of just flying in for a quick city trip to Tokyo or a ski trip in one of Japan’s famous ski resorts.
                            When I came across the Splendours of Japan Tour with Trafalgar (who I have travelled with previously in Peru), it seemed like a great opportunity to take one of my parents overseas to visit Japan, as I knew either of them would appreciate the culture and history unlike anyone else I knew – so I booked my dad a plane ticket, told him to pack his bags, and we were off!
